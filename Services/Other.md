##  Access Control
  * Azure provides the following four platform roles:
      *  Owner - can manage everything, including access
      *  Contributor - can manage everything except access
      *  Reader - can view everything, but can't make changes
      *  User Access Administrator - can manage user access to Azure resources

  * Azure also provides several resource-specific roles. Some common ones are:
      *  Virtual Machine Contributor - can manage virtual machines but not grant access to them, and can't manage the virtual network or storage account to which they're connected
      *  Network Contributor - can manage all network resources, but not grant access to them
      *  Storage Account Contributor - Can manage storage accounts, but not grant access to them
      *  SQL Server Contributor - Can manage SQL servers and databases, but not their security-related policies
      *  Website Contributor - Can manage websites, but not the web plans to which they're connected

Complete list of [Roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles) which can be managed using Role Based Access Control ([RBAC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)) . Manage roles using Access Control (IAM) under your subscription.
