Azure [Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security)

These tools and capabilities help make it possible to create secure solutions on the secure Azure platform.

* The built-in capabilities are organized in six (6) functional areas: 
  Operations,
  Applications, 
  Storage,
  Networking,
  Compute, and 
  Identity. 


##Operations
* Operations Management Suite Security and Audit Dashboard -
    provides a comprehensive view into your organizationâ€™s IT security posture with built-in search queries for notable issues that require your attention.
 You can configure OMS Security & Compliance to automatically carry out specific actions when a specific event is detected

* Azure Resource Manager
  Resource Manager provides security, auditing, and tagging features to help you manage your resources after deployment.Azure Resource Manager template-based deployments help improve the security of solutions deployed in Azure because standard security control settings and can be integrated into standardized template-based deployments. 
  
* Application Insights  
  Application Insights is an extensible Application Performance Management (APM) service for monitoring your live web applications and automatically detect performance anomalies.The service sends you emails if there are any changes in the availability and performance of your app.
  
* Azure Monitor
  Azure Monitor offers visualization, query, routing, alerting, auto scale, and automation on data both from the Azure infrastructure (Activity Log) and each individual Azure resource (Diagnostic Logs). You can use Azure Monitor to alert you on security-related events that are generated in Azure logs.
  
* Log Analytics  
   Log Analytics part of Operations Management Suite . Data from Azure Monitor can be routed directly to Log Analytics so you can see metrics and logs for your entire environment in one place.
   
* Azure Advisor
    Azure Advisor analyzes your resource configuration and usage telemetry and provides security recommendations.
 
* Azure Security Center
  Provides you a single dashboard that surfaces threats, alerts and recommendations that can be acted upon immediately.
    
##Applications
 
 * Web Application vulnerability scanning
   e.g test for vulnerabilities on your App Service app by using the integration with Tinfoil Security to perform one-click vulnerability scanning on your app. It provides report - and step by step instructions to fix them. 
   
 * Penetration Testing
   a) Perform your own penetration tests or 
   b) use another scanner suite or provider
   c) you must follow the Azure penetration testing approval process and obtain prior approval to perform the desired penetration tests.
    
* Web Application firewall
The web application firewall (WAF) in [Azure Application Gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/application-gateway/) helps protect web applications from common web-based attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting attacks, and session hijacking.
